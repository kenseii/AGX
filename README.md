This repo holds the code for my small decentralized cryptocurrency the AGX.

It is built using python 3 and flask.

The libraries that need to be installed are :

1.Flask  
2.Requests  
3.Json  
4.Hashlib  
5.Others are built-in python modules

For the testing i used MyEtherWallet and Ganache
Feel free to fork, PR...

their content is the same as the one of agx.py except the receiver and the flask port

 in production it can be replaced by getting data from request urlparse and keeping them.
 
* #####transaction.json
This file contains the data format of a transaction,
in production it can be replaced by getting data from a form...

Happy coding :-)
